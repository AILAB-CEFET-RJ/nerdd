# LSTM NER -🚫 

**LSTM NER** is a tool that uses the pre-trained model **Pytorch** to detect the recognition entity. It also uses a pre-trained model to perform the identification, differentiating the context window for each text.

This project is a fun and interesting way to explore entity recognition. We will help you configure and run **LSTM NER** in your environment.

## Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed in your development environment:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Pytorch

## How to Run 🏃‍♀️

Follow these simple steps to set up and run HANDY:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AIRGOLAB-CEFET-RJ/nerdd.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```shell
   cd lstn_ner
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run LSTM NER**

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

Now you must check the results of entity recognition and the number of items checked through epochs using EarlyStopping

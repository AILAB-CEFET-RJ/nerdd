# Word2Vec - WordEmbeddings to Vector 🚫 

**Word2vec - Leonidia** is a tool that uses the pre-trained model **Word2vec** to detect the recognition entity. It also uses a pre-trained model to perform the identification, differentiating the context window for each text.

This project is a fun and interesting way to explore entity recognition. We will help you configure and run **Word2vec - Leonidia** in your environment.

## Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed in your development environment:

- C
- GCC
- makefile

## How to Run 🏃‍♀️

Follow these simple steps to set up and run Word2Vec:
